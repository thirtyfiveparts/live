Which IDEs we use and the best features to make use of.

Two top-choices are:

- JetBrains IntelliJ/WebStorm (license required - we will pay)
- VSCode

# Recommendation

We recommend to use WebStorm/IntelliJ.

- Single-click debugging just works™️. VSCode has some issues.
- Run configurations for all apps and tasks.
- Full code indexing and refactoring support. Rename something and have all its usages updated too.
- All tooling is setup and tested regularly.
- Built-in CPU profiling.

Downsides

- Sometimes can be slow and use a lot of memory. There are some useful tips to speed this up though.

TODO: Setup guides can be found somewhere in the docs.
