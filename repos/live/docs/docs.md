Live encourages readme-driven-development.

When working on a large codebase you will start to forget why you did things in a certain way or how to debug something.

Using readme files close to the code they describe and documenting your code with block comments can be a good way to document things.

But trying to read markdown as plain-text is not the easiest thing to do.

You can of course open a markdown preview in your editor, but it still doesn't feel as nice as a rendered documentation site.

Live makes sure that you have a beautiful rendered version of all your documentation instantly editable at all times for all packages by running a single server: `npm run docs`.
