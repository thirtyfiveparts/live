## Getting Started

### Requirements

- [node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/)
- Postgres

### Install dependencies

```
pnpm i
```

### View docs

Our docs are built with [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). It's always good to keep this running so that you can make live changes to the docs as you go, and read them as rendered HTML instead of plain-text Markdown.

```
npm run docs
```

`âŒ˜ + click` on a heading to navigate to the code in IntelliJ.

(The line number doesn't take into account of the frontmatter at the moment so it will be a little off until [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3935) is addressed.)

Read more about Live docs in [docs.md](docs.md).
