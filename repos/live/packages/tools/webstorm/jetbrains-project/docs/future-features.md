# Future Features

> Ideas for future features.

### Generate a project

_TODO_

### Create scopes for each sub-package

_TODO_

In the Project Tool Window you can have it only show files and folders from a scope (defined as a regex).

This tool allows scopes to be automatically created for each package.

- Scopes can filter navigation like find symbols...
- Scopes can be contexts.

### Move changes into a changelist for each sub-package

_TODO_

When working with a monorepo you may want to separately commit changes by package.

This tool allows changes to be automatically added to their packages's changelist.

### Automatic context management

_TODO_



###

Look for nested `jbp.config.js` files.

### Sync with VSCode

### Single process for multiple roots

This would support AppCode and CLion projects we have for native code.

Maybe also Python iml support for our Python modules.

###

set task server to repo

## See misc.xml

We pretty much want everything configurable from json.

We want smart in-place tho. No loss of data.
