# DEBUG

```
j api-extractor-test
npm run project-updater
```

Also use this npm run script to debug. Works well.

Our simple markdown readme generator will prob be better done by subclassing Documenter.
Printing example nodes requires their emitter. Its hard to just work with plain strings.

This will be the way to do it.

Then we need to write a file watcher and integrate that into Live.
